You're right to ask, and I apologize for any confusion. Given that you already have a custom validation rule for the 'dob' field, we can incorporate the date parsing directly into this rule. This approach will handle the date parsing and validation in one step. Here's how we can modify your existing validation rule:

Here's an updated version of your validation rule that incorporates the date parsing:

```php
use Carbon\Carbon;

// In your store or update method
$validatedData = $request->validate([
    // ... other validations ...
    'dob' => [
        'nullable',
        'date',
        function ($attribute, $value, $fail) use ($request) {
            if ($value) {
                $currentYear = now()->year;
                $minBirthYear = $currentYear - 100;
                $maxBirthYear = $currentYear - 18;

                $dob = Carbon::parse($value)->startOfDay();

                if ($dob->year < $minBirthYear || $dob->year > $maxBirthYear) {
                    $fail("The date of birth must be between {$minBirthYear} and {$maxBirthYear}.");
                } else {
                    // If validation passes, update the request with the parsed date
                    $request->merge(['dob' => $dob->format('Y-m-d')]);
                }
            }
        },
    ],
    // ... other validations ...
]);

// After validation, $validatedData['dob'] will contain the correctly formatted date

```

This updated code does the following:

1. It still checks if the 'dob' field is nullable and a valid date.
2. In the custom validation function:
    - It parses the date using Carbon and sets it to the start of the day.
    - It performs the age range validation as before.
    - If the validation passes, it updates the request with the parsed and formatted date.

By updating the request within the validation rule, we ensure that:

-   The date is correctly parsed and formatted.
-   The age range validation is applied.
-   The formatted date is available in the `$validatedData` array after validation.

This approach combines the date parsing and validation into a single step, which is more efficient and ensures consistency. After this validation, you can use `$validatedData['dob']` directly in your model creation or update, and it will contain the correctly formatted date string.

Remember to import Carbon at the top of your controller:

```php
use Carbon\Carbon;
```

This solution maintains your existing validation logic while also ensuring that the date is correctly parsed and formatted, addressing the issue with the date picker potentially giving you the previous day.
